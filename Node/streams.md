These are the notes that I took while reading/taking:
Node Streaming Handbook

	Blend this with stream info in basics.md

Streams
	popular npm modules for stream creation
		through
		concat-stream


	.pipe() is the primary composition operator.
		this method also has a backpressure mechanism which allows us to throttle writes for slow consumers.

		Think of piping different streams together to make coding more elegant and modular

		All streams utilize .pipe() to "pipe" inputs to outputs

		src.pipe(dst)
			src - readable source stream
			dst - writable stream

			all pipe does is take the readable stream (src) and "pipes" the output to a destination writable stream (dst)

			.pipe(dst)
				returns dst for chaining
					the returned dst will become the read stream for the next pipe
						Thus, a.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d)


	Example where streams would be effective


		var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
		    fs.readFile(__dirname + '/data.txt', function (err, data) {
		        res.end(data);
		    });
		});

		The problem is that this buffers the entire data.txt file into memory for every request.  Only after this process, does it write the results back to clients

	Utilizing Streams
		In the above example, with req and res are streams
			Thus, we can utilize fs.createReadStream() instead of fs.readFile()

		var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
		    var stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/data.txt');
		    stream.pipe(res);
		});

		There are two events that are usually used in streams
			data - Emitted for every buffered 'chunk' of binary that's ready to be transmitted

			end - When the stream has finished

				.pipe() takes care of listening for these 2 events
					So we utilize this in the above example
						The file will now be written to clients one chunk immediately after the chunk is read from disk

					Backpressure: If clients are on a high-latency connection, pipe will take account of this and node wont buffer chunks into memory needlessly.

		Compression in streams with oppressor
			Opressor abstracts away setting content-encoding

			Compression is for browsers that support gzip or deflate

			Ex:
				var oppressor = require('oppressor');

				var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
				    var stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/zach.txt');
				    stream.pipe(oppressor(req)).pipe(res);
				});
		Writable Streams
			Creating a writeable sream
				EX:

				var Writable = require('stream').Writable;
				var ws = Writable();
				ws._write = function (chunk, enc, next) {
				    console.dir(chunk);
				    next();
				};

				process.stdin.pipe(ws);

				$ (echo beep; sleep 1; echo boop) | node write0.js 
				<Buffer 62 65 65 70 0a>
				<Buffer 62 6f 6f 70 0a>

				If the readable stream you're piping from writes strings, they will be converted into Buffers unless you create your writable stream with Writable({ decodeStrings: false }).

				If the readable stream you're piping from writes objects, create your writable stream with Writable({ objectMode: true }).

				

				_write params
					chunk
						the data that is written by the producer
					enc
						Is a string which denotes the encoding

						This is only passed when a string has been written AND opts.decodeString is false

					next(err)
						Callback that tells the consumer that they can write more data

						err
							an optional error object, which emits an 'error' event on the stream instance.


		Readable Streams
			Produce streams that can be fed into a writable, transform, or duplex stream

			ex:
				process.stdin.on('readable', function () {
				    var buf = process.stdin.read();

				    console.dir(buf);
				});

				$ (echo abc; sleep 1; echo def; sleep 1; echo ghi) | node consume0.js 
				<Buffer 61 62 63 0a>
				<Buffer 64 65 66 0a>
				<Buffer 67 68 69 0a>
				null

				// Notice the 0a which is the newline from echo

				When data is available on a stream, the 'readable' event fires and you can call .read() to pull in data from the buffer

				When the stream is finished, .read() returns null because there are no more bytes to fetch

				.read(n)
					You can fetch n bytes of data if you wish.
						This doesnt work for object streams

						If we read less bytes than there is in the buffer, those "leftovers" will be shown on the next buffer pull

						if n === 0
							it will output all of the data in the rest of the buffer



			Ex:
				var Readable = require('stream').Readable;

				var rs = new Readable;
				rs.push('beep ');
				rs.push('boop\n');
				rs.push(null);
					// Tells consumer of stream that rs is done outputting

				rs.pipe(process.stdout);

				$ node read0.js
					//beep boop

				We pushed content to rs BEFORE piping to process.stdout (out writable stream) and yet, our complete message was still written.
					This is because when you .push() to a readable stream, the chunks you push are buffered until a consumer is ready to read them.

					Although, it would be even better in many circumstances to avoid this type of buffering and only generate the data when someone asks for it.  We can push chunks on-demand if we define a ._read function on the stream
						Ex:

						var Readable = require('stream').Readable;
						var rs = Readable();

						var c = 1;
						rs._read = function (size) {
						    rs.push(c++);
						    if (c < 10)) rs.push(null);
						};

						rs.pipe(process.stdout);

						// size - how many bytes the consumer wants to read.  We can ignore this if we want.

						$ node FILE.js
						// 123456789

						Here, we only push the number when the consumer is ready to read.

						$ node FILE.js | head -c5
							in this case it would be the 'head stream' that would be requesting 5 bytes from as rs._read process.  For every byte sent, if we added in a delay to the code so that the operating system would send signals to close the pipe, then rs._read would be invoked 5 times (1 time for every byte requested).
								For this to FULLY work, we'd have to add some error handlers,etc. for dealing with external operating system pipes, but you get the main idea.
									If we interface with node streams the whole time, we dont have to deal with these nuances.
