Data Warehousing:  Can take data from a large number of systems and place in into a centralized place.

Normalizaton: This is the process of setting up your schema to reduce redundancy.

Star Schema: The main thing (table) that you're querying for will be at the center of the "star", and related data (tables) what you want to make associations with will be at the "arms" of the "star".  This way, when you are making joins in your table, you are usually 1 join away.
