Instruction Types
  Expressions
    Are made of values and operators

    Always evaluate to a singe value

  Statement
    Don't evaluate to a single value
      Although, an assignment statement can have an expression as a part of itself


Booleans
  True, False
    Make sure to type them with an uppercase T/F

Comparison Operators
  0 == '0'
    False

  42.0 == 42
    True

    Thus, floats can be equal to ints

  0 and 0
    is equal to 0 && 0 in JS

  0 or 0
    is equal to 0 || 0 in JS    

  not True
    > False

    Same as JS's !


Strings
  'hello' * 3
    hellohellohello

  len(STRING_ARG)
    Gives the length

Comments
  # Single line comment

Type casting
  str()
  int()
  float()

  Ex:
    str( int( input() ) + 1)
      If enter 8
      > '9'

Flow Control Statement
  if 'zach' == 'zach':
    print('Yo man!')

    # If it's true, it runs the indented code
      if not, it runs the unindented code
