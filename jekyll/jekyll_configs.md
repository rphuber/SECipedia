Key Takeaways
	Any flags that you pass into jekyll build, pass into jekyll serve
		jekyll serve does a BUILD before deployment

	Don't use tabs in config files

	Utilize Front Matter defaults for DRY content

	Turn on recognition of Github Flavored Markdown
		Ex:
			kramdown:
				input: GFM

Default Configs in _config.yml
	These are run by default and can be overriden on the CLI or in _config.yml

_config.yml Options
	source: _source
		Where files will be read FROM
	destination: _deploy
		Where the files will be written TO
	exclude: [DIR, FILE,...]
		Excludes DIRS/FILES from the conversion
			Relative to the site's source DIR
				Cant go outside of this DIR
	include: [DIR, FILE,...]
		Force inclusion of directories and/or files in the conversion
		Ex:
			.htaccess
	keep_files: [DIR, FILE,...]
		By default, all files in the destination folder will be destroyed when generating the site.  This specifies which files to keep

		The paths are relative to the destination folder

		Ex: Files that are not generated by jekyll

	lsi: BOOL
		Produce an index for related posts

	port: PORT
	host: HOSTNAME

	baseurl: URL
		Serve the website from a given base URL

	detach: BOOL
		Detach the server from the terminal


jekyll build FLAGS
	JEKYLL_ENV=production
		DEF == development
		Ex: You can reference this in code as

		{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
		   {% include disqus.html %}
		{% endif %}

		Ex: Of env utilization in development



jekyll serve FLAGS
	You can use any build flags here
		These are then applied to the site build which occurs right before your site is served

	--skip-initial-build
		Skips the initial site build that occurs before the server is started


Front Matter defaults
	Used so you don't need to repeat Front Matter material over and over
		Ex: Same layout to each file
			Same categories to a post
			Author name custom variable

	To set
		'defaults' key in _config.yml
			Is an array of scope/value pairs that defines which defaults should be set for a particular file path, and optionally, a file type in that path.

			Order of precedence
				The most specific path wins
					See example below
				You can also override the defaults in the _config.yml file with front matter in the file itself.	


			'types' key
				Can be set to
					pages, posts, drafts, ANY_COLLECTION_YOU_DEFINE
				
				We specify a type because we wouldn't ALL files in the project to have a default layout (ex: css, etc.)

		Ex: Add a default layout to all files that are posts
			defaults:
			  -
			    scope:
			      path: "" # an empty string here means all files in the project
			      type: "posts"
			    values:
			      layout: "default"


		Ex: Muliple scope/value pairs
		defaults:
		  -
		    scope:
		      path: ""
		      type: "posts"
		    values:
		      layout: "my-site"
		  -
		    scope:
		      path: "projects"
		      type: "pages"
		    values:
		      layout: "project" # overrides previous default layout
		      author: "Mr. Hyde"

			 // This path would reference the projects folder (if it exists)
			 // These files will have the page.author variable set to "Mr. Hyde"

		Ex: Utilizing your own colleciton in the config
			collections:
			  - my_collection:
			    output: true

			defaults:
			  -
			    scope:
			      path: ""
			      type: "my_collection" # a collection in your site, in plural form
			    values:
			      layout: "default"
