Collections
	As of 12/1/2015 this feature is unstable

	Main idea
		Not everything is a post/page, maybe you want to document the various methods in your codebase,etc.
			Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behaves like Pages/Posts, but also has their own properties/namespace
