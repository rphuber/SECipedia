    "Google Hacking"
    If google indexes ftps, what other types of protocols does it index?

Google Searches
  If someone accidentally does a index.html symlink to their root directory in their web hosting directory, then a user can potentially access all files on the server.
    You'll see page like directory_trav.png

    In general, do a google search for pages like this that show inappropriate file access.  Maybe there's a ubiquitous line of HTML that is persistent in these types of situations.  What about the folder icon pic? (Maybe you can key off of that)

  Look for coporate fileshares that aren't locked down.

  inurl:elmah.axd filetype:axd "Error log for"
    This is for a popular error logging module, but you can use this for other urlnames or files.
      Ex: database.bak

  inurl:ftp inurl:web.config filetype:config
    If you find these ftp's, can these ftps also be written to as well?
    Google will actually index ftp URLs as well
      As long as anonymous access is enabled

      web.config
        ASP.NET config file that contains very sensitive information

      filetype:config
        This helps mitigate false positives, such as open source projects on github.
