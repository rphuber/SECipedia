    If google indexes ftps, what other types of protocols does it index?

Google Searches
  inurl:elmah.axd filetype:axd "Error log for"
    This is for a popular error logging module, but you can use this for other urlnames or files.
      Ex: database.bak

  inurl:ftp inurl:web.config filetype:config
    Google will actually index ftp URLs as well
      As long as anonymous access is enabled

      web.config
        ASP.NET config file that contains very sensitive information

      filetype:config
        This helps mitigate false positives, such as open source projects on github.
