HTML Source
  By looking at the HTML source, you can often view the validations that are occurring.
    Ex: All passwords need to have a max-length of 10 chars and can only be alphanumeric.
      This can easily inform a brute force attack

  HTML source also has a lot of other goodies, so it's important to throughly review it.
    Ex:
      The backend architecture of the app by reviewing the URL structures, etc.
