1) Mapping
  See mapping folder.
  
  Enumerating the application's content and functionality in order to understand what the application does and how it behaves.
    Some of this requires guesswork.

  After enumeration is finished, look at its types of behavior, its core security mechanisms, and the tech stack on the client and the server.

  Look for classes of vulnerabilities, not singular instances.
