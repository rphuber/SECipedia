Same Origin Policy
  Applied inconsistently across browsers, their versions, and even plugins.

Definition
  Essentially is a sandbox.

  Restricts resources from one origin interacting with other origins.

  Was initially defined only for external resources, but now includes schemes such as:
    file://
    chrome://
    etc.

  Origin
    Consists of a hostname, scheme, and port.
