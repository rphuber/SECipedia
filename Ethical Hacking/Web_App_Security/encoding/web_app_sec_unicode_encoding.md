      Ex:
        %u2215
          /

        %u00e9
          é


  UTF-8
    Is a variable-length encoding standard that employs one or more bytes to express each character.

    For transmission over HTTP, the UTF-8 encoded form of a multibyte character simply uses each byte expressed in hex and is delimited by %

      Ex:
        %c2%a9
