Challenge/Response
  A family of HTTP protocols.  "Challenge" from the server (or place that is implementing authentication) and "Response" is what the user provides.
    Ex: Most basic is password based authentication

The HTTP protocol includes its own implementation for authentication.
  This is relatively rare to encounter these protocols on the public facing internet
    Although these auth mechanisms are leveraged on intranets

  This includes
    
    Basic
      Simple auth mechanism that sends user credentials a Base64-encoded string in a request header with each message

    NTLM
      Challenge-response mecahnism and uses a version of the Windows NTLM protocol


    Digest
      Challenge/response authentication.

      Is an application of MD5 cryptographic hashing with usage of nonce values to prevent replay attacks.

        Ex replay attack:  A eavesdropper (Eve) intercepts an encrypted message that initiates a transaction.  If the Eve wants to, she can leverage a "replay" attack and try to "replay" what she intercepted.  Without having to decipher the message, she can simply replay the encrypted message to initiate an unintended transaction.
          If a nonce value (only used once) is added to the encrypted message, the server can see that the nonce value has already been used and disregard the message.
