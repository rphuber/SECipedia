HTTPS
  Recap: The HTTP protocol uses plain TCP as its transport mechanism (which is unencrypted).
    HTTPS is virtually the same application-later protocol as HTTP, but it's tunneled over an encrypted transport mechanism, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
      SSL has been superseded by TLS (transport layer security), but TLS is usually referred to as SSL.
