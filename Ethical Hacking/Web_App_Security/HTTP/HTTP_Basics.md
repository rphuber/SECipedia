HTTP
  Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the core communications protocol used to access the WWW.

  Originally developed for retrieving static text-based resources.

  Uses a message-based model in which a client sends a request message and the server returns a response message.

  The protocol is basically connectionless: however, HTTP uses the stateful TCP protocol as its transport mechanism.  Each exchanged of request/response is an autonomous transaction and may use a different TCP connection.
