If you compromise a user's email account, you have access to everything.

Access Control Flaws
  Often the developer makes wrong assumptions about how a user will interact with the application and will omit access control checks from some application functions.

  To find these, it is tedious.  You need to do probing on every independent part of the application.

Tokenizing Flaws
  Usually created when trying to blacklist

  exs:
    SELECT/*foo*/username,password/*foo*/FROM/*foo*/users
      Utilizing comment syntax


    <img%09onerror=alert(1) src=a>
      Using encoded characters


  Black list filters in WAFs
    Vulnerable to NULL byte attacks
      Inserting a NULL byte anywhere before a blocked expression can cause some filters to stop processing the input and therefore not identify the expression.
        Ex: %00<script>alert('muhah')</script>

      These types of attacks are relatively common in the web app security world.
        As the NULL byte can act as a string delimiter (in certain contexts), it can be used to terminate a filename or a query to some back-end component.

    In some browsers, NULL bytes are simply ignored; so arbitrary null bytes can be inserted with blocked expressions to defeat certain blacklist-based filters.

When crafting input for an attack, think of the ways that the data can be potentially transformed before any white list/sanitizing is met.
  Ex: Is recursive sanitizing in place?
    If not: <scr<script>ipt> becomes <script>

  Ex: If the application first removes ../ recursively and then removes ..\ recursively then the following input can be used to defeat the validation
      ....\/

      If recurive sanitization occurs, when if one one problematic character leads to another.  There could be an recurive loop that crashes the server.
