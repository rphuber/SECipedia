  OWASP Top 10 from a bird's eye view

    We'll be based off of the last document (2013 edition)
    Ordered based on risk (injection is number 1)  
  
    The examples of the vulnerabilities shown in this lecture series aren't meant 
    to be comprehensive (there will be follow up lectures that go into everything in more detail).
      That being said, I believe that there's enough detail to give you a pretty good understanding of what's going on
