Backdoors
    Create backdoor accounts that mimic service accounts

Many pieces of software/hardware have default configurations/passwords
    A big example would be a router which makes it very easy to hack
    Most people dont update firmware for routers/switches/etc

IPv6
    Attack vectors through auto configuration
        On by default
        IPv6 and IPv4 can't communicate, so there are vectors for the translation devices
        Network discovery: This will allow the discovery of a router (router solicitation) on the network or other computers (neighboring node)
