Handshake Protocol
  subprotocol of the record protocol
  The most elaborate part of the TLS protocol
  
  Performs the SSL handshake
    the sides negotiate connection parameters and perform authentication

  requires 6-10 messages (depending on features leveraged)

  Highly variable
    Contingent on
      configurations 
      supported protocol extension

  Message format
    Header
      Message type
        1 byte
      Length
        3 bytes
    The rest the message depends on the message type

  3 common use cases
    full handshake with server auth
    abbreviated handshake that resume an earlier session
    handshake with client and server auth

  Full handshake
    Every TLS connection begins with a handshake

    When is this used?
      If the client hasn't previously established a session with the server, the two sides execute a full handshake
        This is utilized to negotiate a TLS session

    Full handshake process
      The client and server will perform 4 main activities

      1) Exchange capabilities and agree on desired connection parameters
      2) Perform key exchange
        a) Validate the presented certificate(s) or authenticate using other means
        b) Agree on a master secret that will be used to protect the session
      3) Verify that the handshake messages haven't been tampered with.
