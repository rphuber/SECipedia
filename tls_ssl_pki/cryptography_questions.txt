In the context of digital signing, how is RSA and DSA different?

forward secrecy
          Problem
            Computer systems often contain a critical configuration weakness that allows for decryption of all previously recorded internet traffic

            The most common key-exchange mechanism in TLS is based on the RSA algo
              The RSA key used for the key exchange can also be used to decrypt all previous conversations
                Thus RSA doesn't support FORWARD secrecy.
