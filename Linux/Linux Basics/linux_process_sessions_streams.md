Job Control
  kill pid
    terminates a process by sending it a signal
      A signal is a message to a process from the kernel.

      When you run kill, you're asking the kernel to send a signal to another process

      Signals
        There are many types of signals in linux.

        If warranted, linux gives a process the ability to clean up after itself BEFORE the process terminates.
          Exception: The KILL signal

        kill -SIG_NAME pid
        kill -SIG_NUM pid
          To send a signal to a process.
            This doesn't have to do will 'killing' the process (see below.)


        TERM (default signal)
          Terminate the process

        STOP
          Will freeze the process

          This process will remain in memory, ready to pick up where it left off.

        CONT
          To continue running a STOPed process

          Ex: kill -CONT pid

        INT
          Terminates the process

          When you use Ctrl-C in the current terminal, this is the same as
            kill -INT CURRENT_PROCESS_PID

        KILL
          Doesn't allow the process to be cleaned up.
          Only use this as a last resort.

          OS will terminate the process that forcibly removes it from RAM.

          AKA
            Kill -9 PID

          Job Control Signals
            TSTP
              Similar to STOP

              Ctrl-Z
                To make the foreground process to a background process

                fg
                  Bring background process to foreground
            jobs
              To see all suspended processes, etc.

Background Processes
  command args &
    Execute command and put it in the background

    Ex: nano &
      -> [2] 4250

      The shell will respond with the job number and the PID
        Ex: To move the aforementioned command to the fg
          fg 2

    These processes will continue to run, even after you log out.

    Sometimes these background processes can write to your current TTY's stdout/stderr; so if you see something unexpected, this is why.
      To compensate for this, you should redirect the stdout/stderr to a file.

      In bash, you can also use CRTL-L to redraw the screen


Processes/Sessions
  
  Processes
    Use I/O streams to read/write data.

    Processes read data from input streams and write data to output streams

    Each process on the system has a PID (process ID)

          




  Streams

    Standard Input (stdin)
      Streams can be very flexible as the source of an input stream can be a file, device, terminal, output stream of another process.

      For most commands, if you don't specify an input file, it will read from stdin (thus it will interact like cat does-as seen below)

      stdin redirection

        <
          Channels a file to a program's stdin

          Ex: cat < /etc/passwd

          This isn't very common because most unix commands accept filenames as args
            Ex: cat /etc/passwd


    Standard Output (stdout)
      Kernel gives each process a standard output stream
        This is where the process writes its output

      Some commands send output only to stdout (thus you see it on your screen... in most cases), but some commands can send items directly to files.

      $ COMMAND > file
        Redirects stdout from terminal into a file

        file
          Shell will create the file if it doesn't already exist.

          If the file does exist, the shell will erase the original.
            To turn this off in bash
              $ set -C
        
        >
          redirection character
            >> is also a redirection character

      $ COMMAND >> file
        Appends the output to a file instead of overwriting it

        This is very helpful if you're executing multiple commands and want to aggregate logging, etc.

      Piping ( command | command )
        To send the standard output of a command to the standard input of another        

        

    Stream IDs
      1
        stdout (the default)
      2
        stderr

    Standard Error(stderr)
      Output stream for diagnostics and debugging.

      When you see an error on the console; its from stderr

      Error messages
        ls /not_a_directory
          -> ls: /not_a_directory: No such file or directory

        3 components to error messages
          ls
            The program name, but this isn't always shown.  So if you're writing shell scripts, watch out.

          /not_a_directory
            The file name.

          No such file or directory
            The error.

        In general; always address the first error message.  Usually there's a chain reaction that's based on the first problem.





      Ex: redirect stderr to file 'err' and stdout to file 'out'
        ls /yoyo > out 2> err

        2>
          2 is the stderr stream Id in the redirection

      >&
        Redirect stderr and stdout to the same place

        Ex: send stderr and stdout to file 'all_output_streams'
          ls /yoyo > all_output_streams 2>&1

      Common error messages
        Not a directory, Is a directory
          Occurs when you try to use a file as a directory or a directory as a file.
          Ex:
            touch yo
            touch yo/man
            -> touch: a/b: Not a directory

        Operation not permitted
          Can occur when you try to kill a process that you don't own.

        Segmentation fault
          Segmentation fault
            the programmer who wrote the program messed up.  The program tried to access a part of memory that it was not allowed to touch, and the OS killed the process.

        Bus error
          Similar idea to the segmentation fault.  

          Means that the program tried to access some memory in a way that it shouldnt.

          Segmentation fault/Bus error
            If you're getting one of these errors, you might be giving a program some input that it wasn't expecting.




    Control-D
      Stops the current standard input entry (EOF is sent)

      This isn't the same as Control-C, which terminates the program (regardless of input/output)

    $ cat
      If you don't specify a filename, cat implements an interactive behavior because of streams.

      Because you didn't specify an input filename, cat read from the standard input stream provided by the kernel rather than a stream connected to a file.
        In this example, the standard input was connected to the terminal


	A process group is a collection of related processes which can all be signalled at once.

	A session is a collection of process groups, which are either attached to a single terminal device (known as the controlling terminal) or not attached to any terminal.

	Sessions are used for job control: one of the process groups in the session is the foreground process group, and can be sent signals by terminal control characters. You can think of a session with a controlling terminal as corresponding to a "login" on that terminal. (Daemons normally disassociate themselves from any controlling terminal by creating a new session without one.)

	e.g. if you run some_app from the shell, the shell creates a new process group for it, and makes that the foreground process group of the session. (some_app might create some child processes; by default they will be part of the same process group.) If you then press ^Z, some_app's process group is signalled to stop it; and the shell's process group is switched to be the foreground process group again. Then e.g.bg %1 would start some_app's process group again, but keep it running in the background.
