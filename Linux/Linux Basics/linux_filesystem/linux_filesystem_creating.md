Only do this once you've partitioned

mkfs
  Utility that can create many kinds of file systems

  Ex making a ext4 on a dev/sdf4 parition
    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdf2
      Output
        prints diagnostic output as it works, including:
          superblock
            A key component at the top level of the FS database.
            File system metadata that defines the file system type, size, status, and information about other metadata structures
              It's important that mkfs creates a number of backups

            Record a few of the superblock backup numbers
              This will help you recover the superblock if the disk fails
