Composed of levels (in order)
    Hardware
        CPU, RAM, Disks, Network Ports

        Main memory (RAM) is perhaps the most important area of the hardware.
            In raw form, just a big storage area for bunch of 0s and 1s.
                bit
                    0/1
            This memory is where the running kernel and processes reside.

            All input and output from peripheral devices flows through main memory.

            The CPU
                Is just an operator on memory.

                It reads its instructions and data from the memory and write data back out to memory
        State
            Often heard when discussing memory, processes, the kernel, etc.

            A state is a particular arrangement of bits.
    Kernel
        See kernel.md


    User space aka "userland"

        Refers to the kernel allocated parts of main memory that the user processes can access.

            If a process makes a mistake and crashes, the consequences are limited and can be cleaned up by the kernel.
                Obviously, certain user processes (given the right permissions), can do serious harm
        user mode
            restricts access to a usually small subset of memory and safe CPU operations

        Is made of
            Processes aka user processes
                the running programs that the kernel manages

                user processes make up the environment that you directly interact with. 
        Exs:
            GUIs, Servers, Shell

        In general, a process is simply a state (or image) in memory.
            As such "user space" can refer to the memory of the entire collection of running processes.

        Most of the "real action" occurs in the user space
            Refer to user_processes.png
                From the kernel's POV, these processes are the same.

                Shows the layered structure of the types of system components that user processes represent.
                    Network Configuration, etc.
                        Is the closest to the kernel and performs a more singular (simple) task, relative to the layers above.

                    Each layer builds on eachother, you can see the emphasis on modularity. 
                        If a module wants to use another, it's usually at a lower layer.

                    Top layer is the closest to the user's control

        Every user-space process has a user owner
            User in *nix
                An entity that can run processes and own files

                Has a username "zroof" but the kernel manages by numeric ids called "userids"

            Processes are said to run as the owner.

            Root user
                Still runs in the OS's user mode, NOT kernel mode




Linux File System
    Proper to refer to "folders" as directories
    Like a tree
        / - Starts at "root"
        /bin - Binaries and other executable programs
        /etc - System configuration files
        /home - Home directories 
            Ex: /home/zachroof
                Personal files for a user (i.e. music files)
        /opt - Optional or third party software
            Ex: Google Earth
        /tmp - Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot
        /usr - User related programs, libraries, and docs
            Ex: /usr/bin
                Executables for a specific user

                /usr/lib
                /usr/sbin
                /usr/local
                    Locally installed software that is not part of the base operating system
                    ex: /usr/local/crashplan/bin
                    /usr/local/crashplan/etc
                    /usr/local/crashplan/lib
                    /usr/local/crashplan/log

                Sometimes there are alternative installation patterns
                    Ex: /etc/opt/myapp
                    /opt/myapp/bin
                    /opt/myapp/lib
                    /var/opt/myapp

                    Another can be
                        /usr/local/bin/myapp
                        /usr/local/etc/myapp.conf
                        /usr/local/lib/libmyspp.so
                    
                    Another
                        /opt/COMPANY_NAME
                        /opt/COMPANY_NAME/bin
                        /opt/COMPANY_NAME/etc

                    Another (company/product)
                        /opt/google
                        /opt/google/chrome
                        /opt/google/earth

                    Most of the time, applications that are not part of the base OS can bed installed in
                        /usr/local
                        /opt


        /var - Variable data
            Ex: Log files (/var/log)
        /cdrom - A mount point for cds
        /media - Some distros mount removable media here
        /mnt - Used to mount external file systems
        /proc - Provides info about running processes
        /root - Home directory for the root account 
        /sbin - System administration binaries
        /srv - Contains data which is served by the system
            Ex: /srv/www
                Web server files
        /sys - Used to display and sometimes configure the devices known to the kernel

        Shell Prompts
            $ - Normal User
            # - Root

        Shell Shortcuts
            ~ - Home directory of respective user
                Ex: ~jason = /home/json
                    ~root = /root
                    ~ftp = /srv/ftp
                        Services often have their own accounts
