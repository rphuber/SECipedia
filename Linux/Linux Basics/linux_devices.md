Finding the name of a device
  mount
    Shows currently mounted disks

  Query udevd using udevadmin
  Look the the device in /sys

  dmesg
    Prints the last few kernel messages.  You can try and guess the name because the output might contain a description of the devices on your system.

  cat /proc/devices
    Lists the block and character devices for which your system currently has drivers.
      Each line consists of a number and name.  The number is the 'major device number'.
        See "Major/minor device numbers" in linux_devices.md

        If you can guess the from the name, look in /dev for the character/block devices with the corresponding major number.

    Only the udevd option is completely reliable.  If udev isn't available, then try the other methods but remember that the kernel might not have a device file for your hardware.




udev system
  Enbables user-space programs the ability to automatically configure and use new devices.

  Think of udev as a device manager for the Linux kernel

  udevadm
    Allows a lot of admin functionality
    Including, watching the kernel for udev related changes, etc.

    Ex:
      udevadm monitor --kernel
        If partitioning, this will show the old partition devices being removes and the new ones being added

  udevd
    User space daemon

    The kernel can send notifications to udevd upon detecting a new device on the system

    creates symbolic links in /dev to further identify devices
      ex: /dev/disk/by-id
        Each attached disk has one or more entries

        In this folder, udevd names the links by
          interface type, then by manufacturer and model information, serial number, and partition (if applicable)

    How does it work?
      1) The kernel sends udevd a notification event called a uevent
        This occurs through an internal network link
      2) udevd will then load all of the attributes in the uevent
      3) udevd parses its rules, and it takes actions (or sets more attributes based on those rules)

devtmpfs
  Developed in response to some of udev's shortcomings

  Here, the kernel creates device files as necessary, but it also notifies udevd that a new device is available.
    Upon receiving this signal, udevd doesn't create the device files, but it does perform the device initialization and process notification.

  udevd





device files (aka device nodes)
  Are the files that represent devices

  Important note: Not all devices have device files because the block and character device I/O interfaces are not for all use cases.  
    Ex: network interfaces don't have device files.
      While it would be theoretically possible to interact with a network interface using a single character device; it would be very difficult.  As such, the kernel uses other I/O interfaces.

  In general. it's easy to manipulate most devices on a Unix system because the kernel presents many of the device I/O interfaces to processes as files (aka device nodes)
    Although, these interfaces can be somewhat limited (relative to what the device can truly do.)

/dev
  /dev/null
    The kernel controls this device, and will ignore any input written to it.

  Important: The kernel assigns devices in the this directory in the order in which they are found, thus, a device may have a different name between reboots.
    For an alternative solution, see sysfs (below) Also see sysfs and the differences between /dev (below)

    Additionally, you can look into using the disks Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

  ls -la and devices
    For a device, the first character of a files mode will be either b,c,p,s
      b-block device
        Programs access data from a block device in chunks.  A disk device is a type of block device.
          Disk devices
            Disks can be easily split up into blocks of data.  Because their size is fixed (and thus easily indexible), processes have random access to any block in the device with the help of the kernel.
      c-character device 
        Ex: /dev/null, printers directly attached to your computer
        Character devices work with data streams.  You can only read characters from (or write characters to) character devices.  These devices don't have a size and it's the kernel who usually performs the read/write operation on the device.

        When a character device is being interacted with, the kernel can't back up and reexamine the data stream after it has passed data to a device or process.
      p-pipe device
        A 'named pipe' or 'pipe device' is like a character device.
        However, instead of a kernel driver on the other end of the I/O stream, it's another process.
      s-socket device
        Sockets are heavily used in interprocess communication and are frequently found outside /dev

        Socket files represent Unix domain sockets.

    Major/minor device numbers
      When you ls -l a device you'll see 2 comma delimited numbers before the time.
        This number helps the kernel identify a device.

        Similar devices usually have the same number
          Ex: sda3, sda1 have the same number (as they're both hard disk partitions)
sysfs
  Found is /sys

  Provides a uniform view of attached devices based on their hardware attributes through a system of files and directories.  

  /sys/block
    Sym links to all of the block devices

  sysfs is much more granular relative to /dev
    A /dev file is used so a user process can use the device, whereas the /sys/devices path is used to view information and manage the device.

    Ex: A SATA hard disk at /dev/sda might have the path in sysfs: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda
      While you can't rely on /dev/sda to consistently map to the write device, you can with sysfs

      By going into a directory (like that of above) you can see pretty granular file names that correlate to different meta-data (or other parts) of a device.

  udevadm
  To find the sysfs location of a device in /dev
    Ex: udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/sda

dd
  A program that is very useful when working with block and character devices.
    Warning: It is very powerful.  It often helps to write the output to a new file if you're not sure what it is going to do.  Otherwise, you might easily corrupt files and data on a device.

  Sole function is to read from an input file or stream and write to an output file or stream.
    It also can do some encoding in this process.

  dd copies data in blocks of a fixes suze.

  Ex: Transferring a whole FS from one disk to another 
    Extract the entire FS image from the disk with dd and transfer it to a partition on another disk of the same size
  
  Ex: use dd with a character device and some common options
    dd if=/dev/zero of=new_file bs=1024 count=1

      This copies a single 1024-byte block from /dev/zero to new_file.  As an aside (/dev/zero) is a continuous stream of zero bytes.

      Options
        if=file
          This is the input file.  The default is STDIN
        of=file
          The output file.  The default is STDOUT
        bs=size
          The block size.  dd reads and writes this many bytes of data at a time.  To abbreviate large chunks of data:
            b=512
            k=1024
              Ex: bs=1k

        ibs=size, obs=size
          The input and output block sizes (respectively)

          If you can use the same block size for both input and output; us the bs option.

        skip=num
          Skip past the first num blocks in the input file/stream and do not copy them to the output

        count=num
          The total number of blocks to copy.
            You can rate limit long streams and huge files this way.

            You can utilize count and skip together to selectively copy certain parts of a file.

            You can utilize count 

  /dev/sr*
    CD and DVD drives

    Linux recognizes most optical storage drives as the SCSI devices and it will be identified in /dev/sr*
      However, if the drive implements an older interface, it might show up as a PATA device (and be placed in /dev/hd*)

    For the write/rewrite capabilities of optical devices, you'll need to use the "generic" SCSI devices such as /dev/sgo

  /dev/tty*, /dev/pts/*
    ALSO READ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS

    See: terminal in linux_basics.md

    /dev/tty device
      The controlling terminal of the current process

    These are for terminal devices.


  /dev/hd*
    PATA hard disks (older standard for the connection between the hard disk and the computer.)


    If you find a SATA drive (the industry's successor to PATA) listed in here, that means that it's running in a compatibility mode (which has consequences for performance.)
      If this is occurring, check the BIOS settings and see if you can switch the SATA device into its native mode.





  

  /dev/sd*
    Most hard disks

    The "sd" portion of the name stands for SCSI disk
      Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) was originally developed as a hardware and protocol standard for communication between devices (such as disks) and computers
        While the SCSI hardware isn't used in modern computers, the SCSI protocol is nearly everywhere due to its adaptability.  
          Ex: USB storage devices use the SCSI protocol.
            Additionally, ther kernel still uses SCSI command at a certain point when communicating to SATA devices.


    lsscsi
      Lists the SCSI devices on your system.  This tool walks the device paths in sysfs.

      Output:
        [0:0:0:0] disk ... ... ... /dev/sda
          The first set of numbers identifies the address of the device on the system.  The second grouping describes what kind of device it is.  And the last grouping shows the mapping to /dev/

    Ex: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb are the hard disks
      /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 represent partitions on the /dev/sda disk
