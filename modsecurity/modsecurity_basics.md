Top ideas
  Blend between WAF and IDS
  Allows realtime monitoring, logging, and access control.
  
Important usage scenarios

  Real-time security monitoring and access control
    Persistent storage mechanism
      Enables you to track system events time and perform event correlation

    Full request/response buffering
      Allows you to block requests

  Virtual patching
    Is the concept of vulnerability mitigation in a separate layer
      Allows you fix problems in apps without having to touch the application itself
        Aka, block traffic

  Full HTTP traffic logging
    Allows the logging of raw transaction data
      Very helpful in forensics.
    Allows you to select what parts of your logs should be sanitized.

  Continuous passive security assessment
    This is a variation of real-time monitoring, where, instead of focusing on the behavior of external parties, you focus on the behavior of the overall system.
      This is an early warning system that detects abnormalities and security weaknesses before they're exploited

  Web app hardening
    Attack surface reduction
      Where you narrow down the HTTP features that you accept
        Ex: request methods, headers, content types, etc.
