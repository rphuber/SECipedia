Filter Chain
  Enables applications to
    pre-process incoming data
    post-process outgoing data
  Is essentially independent of the traditional request/response cycle process in apache



  mod_ext_filter
    Any CLI that you implement that interacts through STDIN/STDOUT can be leveraged as an Apache Filter.

  Provider
    A filter that is inserted dynamically

  mod_filter
    Allows the filter chain to be configured dynamically at run time.
      Ex: Setting up a proxy to rewrite HTML with an HTML filter and GIF images with a completely separate filter.  This occurs even though the proxy has no idea what the request will be.
        This works by leveraging a filter harness

      Filter harness
        These work by dispatching to different providers according to the actual contents at runtime.

        Any filter may be either inserted directly in the chain and run unconditionally, or used as a provider and run dynamically
          Exs:
            an HTML processing filter that will only run if the content is text/html

  Exposing Filters as HTTP services
    mod_reflector
      Accepts POST requests from clients, runs the POST body through the output filter stack, and sends that as the response
      Ex: You can utilize the mod_deflate module to provide a general compression service, or an image transformation filter might be turned into an image transformation service.

  Implementing Filters
    Via 2 ways: Simple, Dynamic
      you should use one or another
        mixing can have unexpected consequences
        Ex: Simple input filtering can be mixed with either simple/dynamic output filtering

      Simple Way
        Static filtering chains
        The only way to configure input filters
        Sufficient for output filters where you need a static filter chain

          AddOutputFilter
          RemoveInputFilter

        Dynamic Way
          Enables both static and flexible filtering chains
