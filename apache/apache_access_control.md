  In a typical scenario, we can seperate this into 3 sections in our website

    Public Section

    Members Section
      Unique information for a member
        Ex: Order history, etc.

    Admin section

    Setup: Where to keep the user account info?
      Plain text files
        Me: Security implications?
      DBM files

      Database
