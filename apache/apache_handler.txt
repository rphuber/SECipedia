Apache Handler
  A "handler" is an action that Apache invokes when a file is called

  May be configured explicitly
    via filename ext or file location
      These are INDEPENDENT of file type

  Added Via
    Built into the server
    Included in a module
    Action directive

  Files
    Normally, all files are simply served by the server
      Although, certain file types invoke a handler

  Examples
    Modify static content using a CGI script

    ! Action add-footer /cgi-bin/footer.pl
    ! AddHandler add-footer .html

    The CGI script is then responsible for sending the originally requested document (as referenced by the PATH_TRANSLATED env var)
