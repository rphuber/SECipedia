Review everything in this document before deployment

Everything you utilize, make sure to get notifications of updates.
Apache
  Look at https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual#Installation_for_Apache

  Make sure that the Apache version is the latest
    Aka you might need to install from source
    
  Look in Apache folder


  Make sure to bake in modules for DoS evasion
    Ex: mod_evasion, etc.

  server monitoring
    Utilize mod_status
      There are security considerations, but you can leverage it in the firewall layer only (and be secure)
      apache_key_modules.md
      apache_troubleshooting.md

  Look at modsecurity_good_resources.md
  modsecurity_installation.md


    Deploy as a standalone reverse proxy
      See modsecurity_basics.md/reverse proxy

    See modsecurity_basics.md/Apache Security Considerations

    modsecurity_performance_considerations.md

    Look at leveraging third party rulesets as a base
      Do they have ones for WordPres?
      Exs: Core Rule Set project (OWASP)

AWS
  CloudWatch
    Make sure to set up triggers for abnormal spikes in CPU/memory
      If being DoSed in Apache, look at apache_troubleshooting.md


Linux
  Look into fstab and see if noatime is set.  If a partition is mounted with this option, there can be significant performance considerations.

  SSL
    https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/best-practices/index.html

Cpanel
  go through cpanel_install_setup.md
  Should I allow dedicated IPs for servers? Or, just share 1 static IP amongst all clients?
